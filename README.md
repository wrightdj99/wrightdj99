- 👋 Hi, I’m @wrightdj99
- 👀 I’m interested in developing effective, user-friendly applications using mainly Java and React. However, I'll occasionally do a project for fun in Python, C, Golang, etc.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about the newest advancements in Web3, especially how things like the AI and blockchain technology will impact the end-user experience on the web.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects written in Java and that have both a front and a back-end component
- 📫 How to reach me: my email is wrightdj99@gmail.com
